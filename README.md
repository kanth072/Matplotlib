SALES DATA VISUALIZATION USING PYTHON

Overview:

This project presents a structured approach to analyzing and visualizing sales data using Python. By leveraging industry-standard data analysis and visualization libraries, the application transforms raw CSV data into clear, meaningful graphical representations that support data-driven decision-making.
The project emphasizes clean coding practices, professional visualization standards, and reproducibility.

Project Objectives:

Load and analyze structured sales data from a CSV file

Generate professional-quality visualizations

Identify trends, patterns, and distributions in sales data

Apply best practices in data visualization and labeling

Demonstrate practical usage of Pandas and Matplotlib

Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Data Analysis Library: Pandas

Visualization Library: Matplotlib

Dataset Description :

The dataset is stored in CSV format and contains the following attributes:

Product: Name of the product

Region: Sales region

Date: Date of transaction

Total_Sales: Sales value for the given date

Installation and Setup
